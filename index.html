 Virtually all investment wealth is made by sitting. Not buying, or selling, or trading. Just sitting on what you own.
 <br/>

 Markets are down about 20% in the past few months, with five volatile days of up or down more than 4%.
 <br/>

 No, wait .... that's what happened in the summer of 2011 -- which few remember anymore because stocks recovered and surged in the years after.
 <br/>
 
 

 If you're investing for the next week, today is terrible news. 
 If you're investing for the next year, it's probably not much in the way of news. 
 If you're investing for the next decade or more, it's great news.
 
 <br/> 
 
 
 Stocks were down about 25% this year. Historically, that happens a few times per decade. 
 
 <br/>

 We've seen this before. 
 <br/>

 Be patient, long term, diversified, and own good businesses.
 <br/>

 
 The best way to make a fortune is to invest continually and to live for a very long time.
 <br/>
 
 We don't know what the market will do this week, this month, or this year. 
 But we know businesses will create value over time. 
 Problems will be solved. 
 Solutions will be found. 
 Innovation will surprise. 
 And as investors, that's all that matters.
 <br/>
 
 
 "Don't do anything, don't touch anything, just leave it alone," is the best investment advice for most people most of the time.
 <br/>

 That's especially true when markets are panicked.
 <br/>

 
  "The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily." - Charlie Munger
  <br/>
 
 
 
 "It is remarkable how much long term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent." ~ Charlie Munger
 <br/>
 
 The most powerful way to grow your money is learning to live with less, since you have complete control over it.
 <br/>
 
 
 Invest a little bit each month, month after month, and what the market does in any given year matters less over time.
 <br/>

 Persistence and patience often win.
 <br/>
 
 
 
 Read last year's market predictions and you'll never again take this year's predictions seriously.
 <br/>
 
 
 
 
 Rakesh Jyunjyunwala is a great investor. But his secret weapon is that he's been a great investor for 34 years. 
 <br/>

 Time is what makes investing work.
 <br/>

 
 
 
 
 Waiting longer and wanting less are the two most powerful financial forces, and both are in your control.
 <br/>
 
 Five most valuable investing truths: 
 <br/>

 -Compounding takes time
 -Valuations are unpredictable
 -Simple is usually better than smart
 -Volatility is guaranteed
 -The industry is dominated by cranks, charlatans, and salesman.
 <br/>
 
 
 3 Lessons from 20 Years of Investing
 <br/>

 1 - Pay up for quality.
 <br/>

 2 - Average up. Add to winners, not losers.
 <br/>

 3 - If you want/need capital, sell your losers and NOT WINNERS.
 <br/>
 
 
 Never Never invest in High expense ratio Mutual Funds...
 Just to give you an idea between a Regular Plan v/s Direct Plan 
 If 10,000 INR is invested every month for 25 years (assuming 12% return per year)
 Direct plan = 1.79Cr
 Regular plan = 1.41 Cr
 Saving = 38.62 lacs
 You can buy a flat with this savings
 Never invest in a Regular plan...
 Most brokers (Your friend/ICICI securities DO NOT offer Regular plan).
 
 Open an account with a LOW COST BROKER like ZERODHA

 Tag your financial role model
 <br/>
  
 Personal finance is more personal than it is finance. Find a plan that works for you.

 Necessity is the mother of invention.  
 <br/>

 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said two years of digital transformation just took place in two months.
 <br/>
 
 
 
 How long you stay invested for will likely be the single most important factor determining how well you do at investing.
 <br/>
 
 
 Expect the market to lose a third of its value at least once a decade. 
 <br/>

 That's what's happened historically. 
 <br/>

 When you expect it, it doesn't feel as scary when it occurs.
 <br/>
 
 
 
 So many assumptions have been destroyed in the last １２ months. 
 <br/>

 Some things are truly timeless. 
 <br/>

 Do not live below your means. 
 <br/>

 Be Prudent 
 <br/>

 Invest wisely
 <br/>

 Be patient. 
 <br/>

 Be helpful and kind 
 <br/>

 Don't spend all you time on Social Media or Aimlessly browsing the internet
 <br/>

 These will always work.
 <br/>

 
 Things you can control: Your savings, your time horizon, your expectations. 
 Things you can't: What the market will do.
 <br/>
 
 
 Most investment activity is focused on what stocks to buy.
 <br/>

 But most investment results rely on how long you can hold them for.
 <br/>
 
 There is no single right answer with money because there is no single personality with people.
 <br/>
 
 Investing is one of the only fields where doing nothing (sitting and being patient) is a competitive advantage.
 <br/>

 Good companies take care of every person involved with their product, from employees to customers to shareholders.
 <br/>

 Your investing skill isn't proven until it's survived a recession
 <br/>

 
 Start small.1000 INR a month.
 <br/>

 Buy a low cost expense ratio Mutual Fund.
 <br/>

 Up the ante.
 <br/>

 5000 INR a month.
 <br/>

 Then 10,000 INR.
 <br/>

 Eventually, more.
 <br/>

 Buy some stocks.
 <br/>

 Hold them for years.
 <br/>

 The market drops?
 <br/>

 Buy more.
 <br/>

 Big news headlines?
 <br/>

 Ignore ‘em.
 <br/>

 Invest every month.
 Invest for Life
 Invest in Business
 Don't Speculate
 <br/>
 
 Personality characteristics that are harmful to investing: 
 
 1. Overconfidence in forecasts. 
 2. Desire to use leverage. 
 3. Inability to deal with normal setbacks. 
 4. Bored by simplicity. 
 5. Impatience.
 <br/>

 There's no such thing as a normal market or a normal economy.   Stocks and the economy are always in some state of craziness.
 <br/>
 
 No one is smarter than the collective intelligence of millions of other investors. 
 But some are a little more patient and level-headed. 
 <br/>

 The greatest companies keep outgrowing their valuation for decades.
 <br/>

 Good investing is having confidence in the outcome but humility in the path that takes you there.
 <br/>

 We don't know what the market will do this week, this month, or this year.   But we know businesses will create value over time.   Problems will be solved.   Solutions will be found.   Innovation will surprise.   And as investors, that's all that matters.
 <br/>
 
 The markets are volatile, but you don't have to be.
  <br/>

 If 2020 has taught investors one thing it's that no one -- no one -- knows what markets will do in the short run.
 <br/>

 Most of your returns an investor will come from just a few of your investments. It's OK to have losers in your portfolio. Let the few winners do all the work.
 <br/>

 Helpful investing traits:   - Ability to not care about what the market does on a daily basis.  - Not afraid to be wrong for periods of time.  - Ability to remain optimistic amid bad news.
 <br/>

 "I did not succeed in life by intelligence. I succeeded because I have a long attention span." -- Munger
 <br/>

 The wealth formula:   - Solve someone's problem (work)  - Low expectations and ego (save)  - Be optimistic (invest)  - Have a long-term mindset (compound)
 <br/>

 The careers of many investing pundits can be explained by the simple fact that if you tell people what they want to hear you can be wrong forever without penalty.
 <br/>

 Teach your children to invest. It'll change their lives forever.
 <br/>

 Good investing is 1% buying and 99% sitting.

 Quantum Gold Savings Fund - 0.06%

 HDFC Gold Fund - 0.1%
 Nippon India Gold Savings Fund - 0.1%

 <br/>

 
 Always remember, one of the important criteria you need to consider before you buy a GOLD fund is Expense ratio
 <br/>

 If you like to learn more about Expense ratio, please watch this video
 <br/> 
 
 Other criteria(s) to consider whilst selecting a Mutual fund are
 <br/>
 ]
 Standard deviation
 Jension's Alpha

 <br/>
 
 
 
 This is the most important message for investors in MUTUAL FUNDS.
 PLEASE ONLY INVEST IN DIRECT PLAN whilst INVESTING in MUTUAL FUNDS...If you invest through an AGENT or ADVISOR or TOP Securities companies like ICICI SECURITIES, SHAREKHAN etc, you will most probably invest in only REGULAR PLANS..Please open an account with LOW COST BROKER's like ZERODHA to invest in DIRECT PLAN..

 The failure to teach economics in school is intentional. 
 By controlling what is taught, one can selectively control ignorance. 
 The People’s ignorance on important subjects such as money is how the world is controlled.

 People are not educated in economics. And you might ask yourself: 
 why aren't people educated in economics? Well, the truth of currency creation, issuance and control is not taught in our schools. 
 Do you remember being taught these things in their true form?
 Education in money is one of the most important educations a member of any society could gain, as economics forms the bedrock of nearly all social interaction. It's no wonder we have a population of economically illiterate people-- they weren't ever taught the subject. As a result, these economic illiterate masses vote in leaders that are unfit to lead and are also economically illiterate.
 <br/>
 

 Those individuals, few and rare, who do learn the subject of money, did so of their own drive and searching.
 <br/>
 
 This leads us to another very important question: Why isn't the subject of money and currency taught in school? Because if you knew the truth, then they couldn't get away with the lies and deceptions that our system is built upon. If you knew how money really worked, they couldn't hold you down and steal from you any longer. If you were educated, then you would recognize that what is being done should not be done and you could stand up for what's right. Those who make the rules rely on the mass's ignorance to maintain effectiveness. So the rules that get made are that the people don't get educated in the truth, and then the game can be easily played against them and their ignorance.
 <br/>
 
 An idea is the most powerful thing there is. Educate yourself in the basics of money, currency and economics. To fail to do so is to become part of the problem by perpetuating ignorance and electing ignorant leadership.
 <br/>
 
 We will repeat this cycle unless we change something. Education is that change.
 <br/>
 
 
 
 
 If you make 50 investments you will likely earn most of your money on fewer than 10 of them.
 <br/>
 
 That's fine.
 <br/>
 
 That's how successful investing works.
 <br/>
 
 
 Hold stocks for one day: It is called Gambling. 
 <br/>
 
 Hold stocks for one month: It is called Speculating. 
 <br/>
 
 Hold stocks for one year: It is called Hoping.
 <br/>
 
 Hold stocks for 5+ years: It is called Investing.
 <br/>
 
 When talking with others about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and even gold and silver, I find that one very common barrier to their understanding of its importance is a fundamental lack of understanding of the underlying flaws with currency and economics in society as we know it, today.
 <br/>
 
 Remember, an idea is the most powerful thing there is. Educate yourself.
 <br/>
 
 The following is a list of videos and references that I recommend to you to educate yourself, because you won't get this education in school. A few hours spent here can change your life forever. And if enough of us do the same, entire societies can be changed.
 <br/>
 
 Do yourself and your society a favor and please through this material. It only takes a few hours.

 Bitcoin has the first mover advantage in the Crypto space. It is a Store of Value (like Gold) and an Inflation hedge.
 It helps the Unbanked, citizens of country with Hyper inflation. It is Decentralized, Immutable, Borderless, Deflationary,
 Internet currency.It solves the big problem of Double Spending.

 The most asked question is..... Is it the right time to invest?
 My answer… YES! Now is the time to make generational wealth, using this foundational technology called Blockchain.
 And the best part is… all this is possible, even if you’re not an geek or hacker, even if you know nothing about blockchain or cryptocurrencies, even if you’re not a venture capitalist or trader and even if you don’t have lots of free time!
 <br/>
 
 You can participate in the digital gold rush! But if you wait, even for just a few weeks, you’ll likely miss the easy gains!
 If you wait too long, the biggest opportunity in a 
 lifetime will be gone. (Enroll NOW!)

 Great companies can achieve more than even most optimists imagine.
 <br/>
 
 You, the individual investor, aren't judged on your quarterly returns. It's a huge advantage over professionals. Take the long view.
 <br/>
 
 
 Invest for longer and you'll do better.
 <br/>
 
 
 Live on less. Have more.
 <br/>
 
 
 "People who don't read good books have no advantage over those who can't read them." -- Mark Twain
 <br/>
 
 
 The stock market is a casino in the short run, and game in the medium run, and a wealth-creation device in the long run.
 <br/>
 
 
 If you make 50 investments you will likely earn most of your money on fewer than 10 of them.
 <br/>
 
 That's fine.
 <br/>
 
 That's how successful investing works.
 <br/>
 
 
 Start small. 
 1000 INR a month. 
 Buy an index ETF/Debt Mutual fund. 
 Up the ante.
 5000 INR a month.
 Then 10,000 INR. 
 Eventually, more. 
 Buy some stocks. 
 Hold them for years. 
 The market drops?
 Buy more.
 Big news headlines?
 Ignore ‘em. 
 Invest every month. 
 That's WISE
 
 <br/>
 
 
 Your potential is an asset in investing.
 <br/>
 
 
 The market goes up in more years than it goes down, but the down years get all the attention.
 <br/>
 
 The only way to grow your money is to have your desires grow slower than your income.
 That's true whether you make 4 lakhs a year or 80 lakhs million per year.
 <br/>
 
 
 Buy good companies and hold them for a long time.
 <br/>
 
 That's it. That's the strategy.
 <br/>
 
 
 
 The most important investing skill is keeping control of your emotions during booms and busts (bull and bear market).
 <br/>
 
 "In expert tennis, 80% of the points are won, while in amateur tennis, 80% are lost. 
 The same is true for wrestling, chess, and investing: 
 Beginners should focus on avoiding mistakes, experts on making great moves." -- Erik Falkenstein
 
 
 You can't control what the market does but you can control how patient you are and what you choose to pay attention to.
 <br/>
 
 
 Saving: you own a slice of your future.
 
 Debt: somebody else does.
 
 Keep it simple. The goal of investing isn’t to minimize boredom; it’s to maximize returns.
 
 Saving doesn't have to be hard. 
 Investing doesn't have to be complicated. 
 Patience doesn't have to be boring.
 <br/>
 
 
 There's no single right answer with money because there's no single personality with people.

 "Pundits forecast not because they know, but because they are asked." -- John Kenneth Galbraith
 <br/>
 
 
 Your investing skill isn't proven until it's survived a recession.
 <br/>
 
 
 Past market declines look like opportunities, future market declines look like risks.
 <br/>
 
 
 The best way to save money is to increase the gap between your ego and your income.
 <br/>
 
 
 Financial independence is a wonderful goal. Investing is the key.
 <br/>
 
 
 If you make 50 investments you will likely earn most of your money on fewer than 10 of them.
 <br/>
 
 That's fine.
 <br/>
 
 That's how successful investing works.
 <br/>
 
 
 No one knew the market would decline more than 30% in March.
 No one knew it would recover all its losses by August.
 No one knows what it will do the rest of the year.
 
 Investing is like math.
 People try to woo you with complexity, but the simple stuff is what's powerful.
 
 
 Buy good companies and hold them for a long time.
 Example of a good company is ITC
 That's it. That's the strategy.
 
 Personality characteristics that are harmful to investing: 
 
 1. Overconfidence in forecasts. 
 2. Desire to use leverage. 
 3. Inability to deal with normal setbacks. 
 4. Bored by simplicity. 
 5. Impatience.
 
 
 Compounding is the 8th Wonder of the world - Einstein
  
 Starting capital = 1,000
 
 First double ---> 2,000 (2X)
 Second double --->4,000 (4X)
 Third double ---> 8,000 (8X)
 Fourth double --->16,000 (16X)
 
 You get the idea!
 
 
 
 
 
 If you don't hold onto your winners, you *cannot* generate life changing returns.
 
 Much easier to find a handful of super stocks and hold; than jumping from one idea to the next.
 
 Not too many world-class compounding machines around - its a simple fact.
 
 
 When the leading growth names rally 10/20/30 or even 40% in a day on super high volume, that is a sign of institutional demand and it is *not* a bearish development.
 
 Big money moves big stocks and it usually buys over several days.
 
 
 
 
 Some lessons I've learnt -
 
 i. Only invest in the very best high-growth businesses
 ii. Pay up for a compounding machine
 iii. Quality > valuation
 iv. Invest when mgt. is top notch
 v. Hold onto winners; be ruthless in cutting losers
 vi. Be wrong; but don't stay wrong
 
 
 In investing, there is no such thing as the "house's money".
 All the money which you have invested is YOUR money; it is the value of your share in real world businesses. 
 If you treat this business like a casino, you'll walk out of the house like most gamblers do - without money.
 
 
 
 
 Over the next few years, the real fireworks likely to occur in online payments and ecommerce marketplaces. 
 Software has already been discovered by the herd.
 
 
 Macro is not my game; neither do I dwell on it but lately a lot of chatter about the looming high inflation, the death of the dollar, destruction of fiat currencies etc.
 Given the severe debt overhang; high inflation is *extremely* unlikely + rates *not* going higher IMHO.
